The map below shows my route through Europe between Canterbury (UK) and Venice (ITA), an 80-days hiking trip. I tried to summarize the most frequently asked questions people had asked me on the map. 
The track was exported from Komoot, and post processed in Python to get the elevation graph.

The first part of my journey was on the Via Francigena, a really old pilgrimage route between Canterbury and Rome. 
I knew I wanted to avoid the Po Valley in northern Italy, further along the Via Francigena, so I deviated in Besan√ßon and freestyled my way to Basel, which is on the River Rhine. 
From there it was easy, I followed the river upstream and I got to Bregenz, which is on the easternmost shore of the Konstanz Lake. 
There I started crossing the Alps on the famous trans-alpine stretch of the E5 trail. The day before crossing into Italy at Passo del Rombo, I climbed up to 2,995 m at the Pitztalerjochl. 
I went down the Val Passiria to Merano, then Val d'Adige to Trento, and Valsugana to Bassano del Grappa. Two days in the scorching heat of the Po Valley and I was in Venice.
